# Stochastic with Alert

Stochastic with Alert is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is based on the standard Stochasticstochastic oscillator indicator. It finds points where one of the stochasctic lines either goes out of the boundary levels or returns into the boundary levels. It can also detect crosses of the main and the signal lines of the stochasctic oscillator. This indicator supports all types of alerts.

The indicator draws its arrows in the main chart window while the stochastic oscillator itself is displayed in the separate chart window.

It is a non-repainting indicator.
